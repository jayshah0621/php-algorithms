/*
 * Selection Sort Algorithm
 * 
 * This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm.
 * 
 * In this algorithm, the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. 
 * 
 * Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.
 * 
 * The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, 
 * and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. 
 * 
 * This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.
 * 
 * This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexities are of ÎŸ(n^2).
 * 
 * In my implementation, I have used array_slice with preserved keys as the array_search has to find the index of the minimum value.
 * 
 * If there are 2 similar values and the keys are not preserved then array_search will return the first index of similar values,
 * and the final result will not be a sorted array.
