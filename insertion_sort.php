/*
 * Insertion Sort Algorithm
 * 
 * This is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm.
 * 
 * It is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements.
 * 
 * The insertion sort algorithm is an algorithm that is used by people in their everyday life than other algorithms. 
 * Take playing cards as an example, we take one card at a time from the pack and insert it into the correct position in our hand. 
 * To find the correct position for a card, we compare it with each of the cards already present in hand.
 * 
 * In this algorithm, a sub-list is maintained which is always sorted.
 * 
 * An element which is to be inserted in this sorted sub-list has to find its appropriate place 
 * and then it has to be inserted there. Hence the name, insertion sort.
 * 
 * The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into the sorted sub-list.
 * 
 * While working with small arrays Insertion sort is one of the fastest algorithms, even faster than Quick sort.
 * 
 * This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n^2).
